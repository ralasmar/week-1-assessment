/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where the the requirements for the system are defined. Input is gathered from users and stakeholders and the strengths and weaknesses from the current system are learned to determine where opporunity for improvement is " 
const design = "This is the third step, in which the plan is reviewed to determine how the goals will be accomplished and what the design specifications are."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step where the development starts by following the design plan guidelines."
const testingAndIntegration = "this is the fifth step, where we test to make sure things are working and fix any issues that may arise. In this step we want to make sure the code meets the requirements."
const maintaining = "this is the sixth step, which is regular updating of the software as conditions change and new requirements are determined. "
